                <h2>BrowserSnake</h2>

                </ul>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    I used this project to learn Javascript! I thought it would be an interesting way to learn the core front-end web technologies and apply them to an interesting project.
                    When learning a new programming language I prefer to research the basics and then build a project from there, picking up useful information and applying it so that it sticks.
                </p>

            </div>
            <h1>Why is this interesting?</h1>
            <div class="expandableContent">
                <h2>It helped me secure my first IT job!</h2>
                <p>
                    For the 'Senior Application Support Analyst' role at Bournemouth University I was given a written Javascript test to see if I was capable of writing code for the ServiceNow platform.
                    I was not familiar with the ServiceNow platform at the time but I had a really solid grasp of Javascript from this project so I was able to pass the paper test!
                </p>
                <h2>Pure Javascript!</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose to create this project (and all of my web projects hosted here, including the website itself!) without the use of any frameworks or external code.
                    I did this for a couple of reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Frameworks come and go and I wanted my web projects to endure</li>
                        <li>I personaly beleive that it is best to learn the fundementals well</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>I can, and have, written code for functonality which I could have accessed with a single function call from a Javascript framework - but it is my belief that I learned more by not relying on frameworks to do the heavy lifing.</p>
                <p>Plus, I can likely pickup a particular framework pretty quickly from my knowledge of Javascript, but I might not be able to pickup a new framework as quickly had I learned Javascript using from a specific framework.</p>
                <h2>Object Oriented Programming without Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Every object in the game (such as snakes, bullets, enemies, and powerups) use a base Javascript object called 'Entity'.
                    The 'Entity' object is my way of bringing object-oriented programming to Javascript, as the 'Entity' acts as a parent class, with child classes inheriting common functions, such as handling collision, movement, and some AI functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is some pseudo code to demonstrate this:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function Entity() {
	//'entity' here is an object. 
	//Other "classes" can extend this object.
	var entity = {
		//Example of inheritable property
		aiDriven: false,
		//Example of inheritable function
		moveStep: function() {
			//Functionailty to move the entity
		},
	};
	//'allEntities' is useful for looping through all the entities
	//The gamestate makes use of this to detect collisions, remove all the entities on reset etc
	allEntities.push(entity);
	return entity;
}

function Snake(snakeNameParam) {
	//Extend the Entity base object
	var snake = new Entity();
	//Example of setting a new property
	snake.snakeName = snakeNameParam;
	//Example of setting a  new function
	snake.move = function() {
		//As 'Snake' inherited from 'Entity', can access the properties and functions of 'Entity'
		if (snake.aiDriven) {
			snake.moveStep();
		}
	};
	return snake;
}

//New 'Snake' with all the functions and properties of Entity and Snake "classes"
let playerSnake = new Snake("Ryan");</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>For a project like this, I needed some way of defining classes (as I am used to from Java and C#) and this idea of extending Javascript's objects worked really well!</p>
                <h2>Internet Explorer Compatibility</h2>
                <p>BrowserSnake is compatible with IE6 and upwards!</p>
                <p>
                    You might be asking yourself 'why would he even bother doing this'? And I had a couple of reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Internet Explorer has the worst compatibility of any modern browser, so I figured that if BrowserSnake could run on IE then it could run anywhere</li>
                        <li>IE compatibility meant implementing polyfills for certain essential functions which was an interesting technical challenge</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>I developed an IE compatibility js file for BrowserSnake but I now use it throughout the site as there is no harm in having extra compatibility.</p>
                <h2>Stored settings</h2>
                <p>
                    The game uses local storage (when not running in IE compatibility mode) to store the user's name, settings, and high score.
                    The idea is that you setup the game to your liking and can then revist it without going through the initial setup again and again.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1>What skills does this show off?</h1>
            <div class="expandableContent">
                <h2>DOM manipulation</h2>
                <p>
                    This project shows that I am highly proficient at manipulating DOM elements using Javascript.
                    Creating a game engine within a browser requires the dynamic creation of new elements and the ability to move the various game elements around the game board.
                    The Snakes themselves, for example, are div elements and each snake has it's own div elements as children that represent the body segments.
                </p>
                <h2>Creativity</h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, HTML, and CSS were not exactly designed to be used as a game engine so it took a fair bit of creativity to get a game engine running at all within the browser.
                    I had to implement a dynamically resizing gameboard, grid-based collision system, movement system, dynamic scoreboard system, and more all from scratch for this game.
                    Each system uses div elements on the page for visual representation and a complex gamestate behind-the-scenes to handle the game logic.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, the design of the game, in it's systems and visual design, all took a bit of creative flair!</p>
                <h2>Dedication</h2>
                <p>
                    I started work on BrowserSnake back in 2017 and have been tweaking/adding to it on and off since then.
                    As my knowledge of Javascript has increased, I have come back to this project to use my improved skills to better the project.
                </p>
                <p>At present, BrowserSnake has nearly 2000 lines of code and that is after many optimisation passes over the years. It took a few years but I am happy to have finished such a huge project.</p>
                <h2>Quality</h2>
                <p>
                    My hope is that, if you played the game before reading these sections, is that you did not come across a single bug.
                    I have spent a great deal of time fixing the many, many bugs over the years. The game now is, as far as I can tell from my testing, bug-free.
                </p>
                <p>I have also spent a good deal of time optimising the game so it should run fairly well on slower devices too (it runs great on my phone!).</p>
                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <p>
                    A big focus of the project was the idea of having BrowserSnake run anywhere, on any-sized screen, on mobile or desktop.
                    Anything that can run Javascript should be able to run BrowserSnake!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of the game code is dedicated to scaling and re-scaling.
                    The game can rescale itself after the page has finished loading too, to account for users flipping phones into horizontal mode etc.
                </p>
