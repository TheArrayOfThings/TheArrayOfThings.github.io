<h3>Animal cognition: can animals comprehend or even learn human language?: </h3>
<p>
Many of us have heard a parrot trained to repeat a word or two, common phrases repeated to it again and again but this doesn't mean it comprehends what it is saying. Animal cognition is the study of animal intelligence; we often consider our use of language to be unique to our intelligence. After all; we can't learn animal languages because they're simple noises to denote simple things, or so we think. So if an animal was able to comprehend or even use human language it would be an indication of their cognitive power. Perhaps their language is more complex than we think and we just can't understand it? 
</p>
<p>
It can be presumed that for animals to be able to comprehend human language they need to have the same part of the brain that humans use for language or at least an equivalent to it. 
</p>
<p>
There are two areas of the cerebral cortex in the brain associated with language comprehension in humans, the first of these being Wernicke's area; it's crucial in giving meaning to words and associating objects with words (Mesulam 2000). We know this because Wernicke’s aphasia, which damages this area, causes severe speech impairments and significantly reduced ability to comprehend written words (Robson et al. 2014). The second of these areas is Broca's area which is involved in the production of speech, be it verbal or by using gestures (Ferrari and Waal 2012). Both the Broca's area and Wernicke's area have analogous components in chimpanzee and other primate brains but other non-chimpanzee primates lack the link between Wernicke's area and Broca's area (Everaert and Bolhuis 2013) 
</p>
<p>
So we know certain animals contain analogues to the parts of the brain required for language comprehension but can they use this component to speak in our language? At this point it would be best to note that language and speech are different things, language refers to marks or sounds with a particular meaning attached; while speech is simply the sounds made (Peng 2005). We know that parrots can speak, even say different words to different commands and primates can do a similar thing with sign language. However they cannot comprehend the meaning behind our language, although these animals contain similar components to the language parts of our brain they don't possess the connections to confer meaning to words (Shettleworth 2010). 
</p>
<p>
Therefore other creatures do possess parts of their brains that can be used for speech but they cannot comprehend language, they have the vocal capacity to imitate sounds but don't comprehend the meaning of them.
